CQ CQ CQ

WHY: 

I was shocked when I found out that the no nonsense stuff were no longer free when I had been recommending them for years. Even used them for my own upgrades from Tech Plus (Thank you). I like and admire that the technician guide is still free though. I can't fault anyone trying to make an honest dollar, and I hope he makes a lot of money. 

However, charging for editing a public domain document that took me only a couple hours to erase wrong answers from was easy and doesn't infringe. Elmering isn't for profit, so I took on the task of elmering my fellow hams in this endeavor and created these "simple study" question pools. These will forever be free just as the question pools are. Thanks to HamExam.org. Great resource! 

HOW THIS WORKS:

* No one has time to study!!!! Stop saying this like your different. You're not. You don't have time to study either. 
So do it. If you really want to do it, then do it. Stop saying you don't have time. I don't care to hear it and you really don't want to say it do you? Frankly, I upgraded because I got tired of saying it. 
* Don't try to understand everything before the test. This is a hobby we all practice at, and never stop learning from. In fact the test I took decades ago had different technology than we have today.
* Don't try to learn from a test. Learning comes from doing/experience. Someone will elmer you. You will learn by doing.   
* Don't try to memorize every detail just familiarity. We are wanting that familiarity. By re-reading we get this familiarity. We will recognize the right answer. (right now you got the word familiarity in your head, see?)
* These tests just prove you invested the time, and will take seriously, your actions on the air. You worked for a ticket you don't want to lose. Thus, this is a world-wide congenial hobby you become involved in.   

DIRECTIONS OR RULES:

* Print these questions. 
* Read, AT LEAST, one page every day. I recommend reading them in bed until they put you to sleep. This rule stays in effect until the test is passed.
* After reading three or more times, try on line practice tests at HamExam.org until passing with ease.
* Schedule your test. 
* Pass the test

These rules work. I did this for my General and Extra. I did this on a whim two weeks before going to Hamvention and passed yet I'm the worst test taker ever. 
If you need to upgrade again, do it now. Start this over until you get Extra. Don't delay upgrading, it's not worth waiting to do later. 

Welcome, find an elmer, and enjoy the hobby.
